 AI Stylist: Image-Based Recommendation System  
 Overview  
The AI Stylist project is an image-based recommendation system that leverages deep learning and **machine learning** techniques to recommend products to users. By combining pre-trained models for visual feature extraction (e.g., VGG16 and ResNet50) and hybrid approaches for content-based and collaborative filtering (e.g., TF-IDF + Word2Vec), the system provides accurate and meaningful product recommendations.
Features  
- **Content-Based Filtering:**  
  Recommends items based on the textual and visual similarity of products using techniques like TF-IDF and Word2Vec.  
- **Collaborative Filtering:**  
  Suggests products based on patterns in user interactions using visual embeddings extracted by VGG16 and ResNet50.  
- **Hybrid Recommendation Approach:**  
  Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for robust and personalized recommendations.  
- **Feature Embedding Analysis:**  
  Uses embeddings to verify the grouping of visually or semantically similar items.

## Workflow  
1. **Data Preparation:**  
   - Collect product images and associated metadata.  
   - Preprocess the images (e.g., resizing, normalization) and clean textual data.  
2. **Feature Extraction:**  
   - Extract visual features using **VGG16** and **ResNet50**.  
   - Analyze text-based features with **TF-IDF** and **Word2Vec**.  
3. **Embedding Analysis:**  
   - Visual embeddings are inspected to ensure that similar items are grouped together meaningfully.  
4. **Recommendation Generation:**  
   - **Content-Based Filtering:** Combines visual and textual similarities.  
   - **Collaborative Filtering:** Uses user interactions and visual embeddings for product suggestions.  
5. **Evaluation:**  
   - Recommendations are evaluated using qualitative and quantitative measures to ensure accuracy and relevance.  

## Results  
- **Visual Recommendations:**  
  Products are recommended based on their visual similarity, using embeddings from **VGG16** and **ResNet50**.  
- **Text-Based Recommendations:**  
  Recommendations are generated based on product names, descriptions, and metadata using **TF-IDF** and **Word2Vec**.  
- Hybrid Recommendations: 
  Combines both visual and text-based filtering for robust suggestions.
